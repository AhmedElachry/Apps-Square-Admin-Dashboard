# Apps-Square-Admin-Dashboard
this is the final project in Apps Square Academy React Course by Eng Mohamed Adel \
i have used a pre-equipped template for the UI and i have implemented the logic for \
Login Auth, Routing and CRUD Operations using Redux Toolkit Query \
most of the work that done by me located in \
"src\views\managment" \
"src\views\pages\auth" \
"src\features" for redux slices \
"src\app" for redux Store and api Slices \

unfortunately at my last try to test the app i couldn't login due a server error \

i hope it back to work again
